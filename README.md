Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a person, it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them.

There is no greater issue in modern times than the illusion of privacy, as corporate conglomerates become increasingly aware of every aspect of your personal life. Your data is becoming a tool to use against you. There are few ways to securely transmit messages without them being intercepted or used for profiling.

Dictio is a secure, private, and free messaging service that offers the delivery of securely encrypted messages, whithout compromising anonymity.

Dictio allows messages to be encrypted with any passphrase and has a wide range of options, including message expiration, message delay, SMS and email notification, and the ability to restrict the number of times a message can be viewed before it is permanently destroyed. No logging.
